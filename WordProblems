1. In order to accommodate group rights into our system we would first need to define which users belong into which group and which group member can alter the rights of the group and ,secondly, we would have to create a function that would be able to alter all the users' rights that belong in a certain group based on the certain input we have received, from the group leader. With regard to the similarities between groups and roles, groups and roles both have a similar hierarchy system,in the groups case we have the group leader and in the roles case we have managers that have the highest access rights. Furthermore, with roles we also get a sense of grouping because users with a certain role have the same rights. As far as the differences are concerned, a group can change its rights, but in the case of roles only a member of a role with greater access rights can change another role's rights.
